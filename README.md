# Python_Apps
The first step of this project is to build a web map application using python to show world population by color, all volcanoes in the world with pei>6 (population exposure index) as well as volcanoes in different regions with pei>6. 
The second stage is to show volcanic spots with vei>5 (volcanic explosive index). By clicking on the volcanic spots, a popup gives you information about pei and vei values.
